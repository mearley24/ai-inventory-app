## Key Features Explained

### Inventory Items
Each inventory item includes:
- Unique ID
- Name
- Barcode (optional, from scanning)
- Quantity
- Category
- Description (optional)
- Low stock threshold (optional)
- Creation and update timestamps

### Projects & Time Tracking
Each project tracks:
- Name and description
- Color coding for visual identification
- Total accumulated time
- Individual time entries with start/end timestamps

### AI Product Identification
When scanning a barcode:
1. Camera detects and reads the barcode
2. System checks if item already exists
3. If new, AI analyzes the barcode number
4. Suggests product name and category
5. Pre-fills the add item form
6. User can accept or modify suggestions

## State Persistence

The app uses Zustand with AsyncStorage to persist:
- All inventory items
- All projects and time entries
- Active timer state (survives app restart)

## Future Enhancements

Possible features to add:
- Export inventory to CSV/PDF
- Inventory analytics and charts
- Photo capture for items
- Bulk barcode scanning
- Time tracking reports and exports
- Project analytics and insights
- Cloud sync across devices
- Sharing and collaboration

## Notes

- The app is optimized for iOS
- Requires camera permissions for barcode scanning
- AI features require an OpenAI API key (pre-configured in Vibecode environment)
- All data is stored locally on the device
